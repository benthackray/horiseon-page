# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description
This page functioned completely fine when accessed on the browser, however in the html, there were some improvements to be made. 
I wanted to reconstruct the code to align with proper html semantics.
With the new formatting, the code is easier to navigate and more accessable for those who view it.
I learned how using the proper semantics can make the code of a page more easy to understand and ready for future revisions
